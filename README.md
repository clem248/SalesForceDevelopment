"# SalesForceDevelopment" 

Hello! 
My name is Aman, and that, 
That's some kind of a summary of everything that i have done and haven't in this task.

So, i think i have done most of the assignment. I added search, show cart, add a product, filtering, showing account name and number, a few unit tests, coverege was only around 40%, ordering, Checkout. 

What would i develop more? 

I would rebuild the architecture. I used too many functions in 1 component(productSearch), that's why the code became not-readable. Also, my UI looks not the same as in TA.
Product lists are shown i 1 column, i had to make it look better. I had better add close button in each modal. Well, i did it only on some of them. 
In intelij idea i created  trigger package, test package, but when i created a file it anyway was created in classes package. I filled the products with random names and descriptions and didnt use real pictures. It is a prototype version.

What i didnt do?
I didn't add a button on Account layout that would lead to Order Management page.  I didnt create an unmanaged package, cause it needed 70% coverege with test of apex classes, while i had only around 40% and didnt know how to make more. Also OrderItemTrigger's 51% coverege wasnt counted while creating unmanaged package and always gave me an error. So, i tried to create it but i failed.

Overall, i'm quite satisfied with the work i have done. I see problems, mistakes in my work , but i also see solutions and ways to upgrade it. 

Thank you)
